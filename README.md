### **Project Description**
Our group chose the topic based on Food and Beverages. Therefore, we decided to open a restaurant hence we provide our customers an online website to allow them to learn further information regarding our restaurant via online. Our website is designed specifically to ease the accessibility to our dear customers. Indirectly this thing has promoted our restaurant online without using a lot of paper and manpower. Our restaurant is named ‘Trio Cis’ which refers to ‘trio’ as three and the word ‘cis’ which is one of the famous Malaysian slang refering to cheese. There are three main cheeses used in the menu namely cheddar, mozzarella, and cheese sauce.
